<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![PLANTABIT-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/556a99cc-cf83-49c7-90d1-c87ac5ca3f60)


üåè Ah, look at that beautiful boiling 'pale-blue dot'. Glorious age of selective environmentalism, where saving the planet means passionately advocating for the rights of endangered tree frogs while sipping from plastic cups and ignoring the latest wildfire choking out another chunk of the Amazon. Who cares if the oceans are boiling, and polar bears get a few more icebergs to cling to? But hey, at least we're putting stickers on our laptops about saving the sea turtles.

ü•§ Let's get this straight. Why don‚Äôt we care about Earth? It‚Äôs not just climate change anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs a climate crisis. Scientists are raising their voices to stop, or at least slow down, the crisis. The interesting part? The reason we don‚Äôt care about global warming might actually be rooted in evolution. Yeah, we've evolved that way.

Here's why:
* **Present Survival Over Future Importance** The basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter was crucial in human evolution. As a result, people tend to value the present more than the future.
* **Effective Leadership by a Few** - In the processes of hunting and gathering, it was more economical and safer for a few leaders to take the lead in hunting rather than everyone participating.
* **Lack of Concern for Future Generations** - Throughout human evolution, our concern has typically extended only as far as our great-grandchildren. Therefore, while we take the harm experienced by close relatives seriously, but not on distant generations.
* **Sunk Cost Fallacy** - People feel reluctant to abandon the investment in fossil fuels, but in rational decision-making, sunk costs should not be factored into current choices.

Earth is boiling, sea levels are rising, and the end is near. We need to act now. That‚Äôs why I created this app, Pequod, based on four evolutionary reasons. People tend to care more about animals, so we‚Äôve got animals for you to care for. Perform environmentally-friendly habits to earn more time for your animal. But be warned ‚Äî when the timer hits zero, your animal dies and turns into plastic waste.
